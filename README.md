## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development
When doing this challenge, I realized I still have trouble with responsive design, especially mobile and image responsiveness.

For example, the image would overflow when the mobile view was set for some devices. To address it, I set the overflow property value to scroll so the user can still see the full image, but I think there is a better way to handle this scenario.

I also found the image color didn't match the design either.

I'm hoping to improve on responsive web design.
